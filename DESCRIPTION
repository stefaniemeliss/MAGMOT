Description: In this project, we examine the effects of monetary
    reward on incidental learning and how this is influenced by
    experiencing curiosity. This includes behavioural experiments
    conducted online as well as an fMRI study to investigate the neural
    underpinnings of the effects. We use dynamic stimuli (e.g. short movie
    clips) to increase the ecological validity of our research.
