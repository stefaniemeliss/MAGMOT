# MAGMOT
 This repo contains all code used to generate and analyse data from the MAGMOT project looking at reward-motivated learning and how it is influenced by experiencing curiosity.

This project includes three data sets:
- an online pilot study to determine the main dependent variables (referred to as "fin")
- an online main study to determine behavioural effects (referred to as "kittenv2")
- an fMRI study to investigate neural underpinnings (referred to as "MAGMOT")

To run all behavioural R analysis, please use this Binder
